## Name
must-gather:analyze

## Synopsis
```
/must-gather:analyze [must-gather-path] [component]
```

## Description

The `analyze` command performs comprehensive analysis of OpenShift must-gather diagnostic data. It runs specialized Python analysis scripts to extract and summarize cluster health information across multiple components.

The command can analyze:
- Cluster version and update status
- Cluster operator health (degraded, progressing, unavailable)
- Node conditions and resource status
- Pod failures, restarts, and crash loops
- Network configuration and OVN health
- OVN databases - logical topology, ACLs, pods
- IPsec configuration and tunnel status
- Kubernetes events (warnings and errors)
- etcd cluster health and quorum status
- Persistent volume and claim status
- Prometheus alerts

You can request analysis of the entire cluster or focus on a specific component.

## Prerequisites

**Required Directory Structure:**

Must-gather data typically has this structure:
```
must-gather/
└── registry-ci-openshift-org-origin-...-sha256-<hash>/
    ├── cluster-scoped-resources/
    ├── namespaces/
    └── ...
```

The actual must-gather directory is the subdirectory with the hash name, not the parent directory.

**Required Scripts:**

Analysis scripts must be available at:
```
plugins/must-gather/skills/must-gather-analyzer/scripts/
├── analyze_clusterversion.py
├── analyze_clusteroperators.py
├── analyze_nodes.py
├── analyze_pods.py
├── analyze_network.py
├── analyze_ovn_dbs.py
├── analyze_ipsec.py
├── analyze_events.py
├── analyze_etcd.py
├── analyze_pvs.py
└── analyze_prometheus.py
```

## Error Handling

**CRITICAL: Script-Only Analysis**

- **NEVER** attempt to analyze must-gather data directly using bash commands, grep, or manual file reading
- **ONLY** use the provided Python scripts in `plugins/must-gather/skills/must-gather-analyzer/scripts/`
- If scripts are missing or not found:
  1. Stop immediately
  2. Inform the user that the analysis scripts are not available
  3. Ask the user to ensure the scripts are installed at the correct path
  4. Do NOT attempt alternative approaches

**Script Availability Check:**

Before running any analysis, first verify:
```bash
ls plugins/must-gather/skills/must-gather-analyzer/scripts/analyze_clusteroperators.py
```

If this fails, STOP and report to the user:
```
The must-gather analysis scripts are not available at plugins/must-gather/skills/must-gather-analyzer/scripts/. Please ensure the must-gather-analyzer skill is properly installed before running analysis.
```

## Implementation

The command performs the following steps:

1. **Validate Must-Gather Path**:
   - If path not provided as argument, ask the user
   - Check if path contains `cluster-scoped-resources/` and `namespaces/` directories
   - If user provides root directory, automatically find the correct subdirectory
   - Verify the path exists and is readable

2. **Determine Analysis Scope**:

   **STEP 1: Check for SPECIFIC component keywords**

   If the user mentions a specific component, run ONLY that script:
   - "pods", "pod status", "containers", "crashloop", "failing pods" → `analyze_pods.py` ONLY
   - "etcd", "etcd health", "quorum" → `analyze_etcd.py` ONLY
   - "network", "networking", "ovn", "connectivity" → `analyze_network.py` ONLY
   - "ovn databases", "ovn-dbs", "ovn db", "logical switches", "acls" → `analyze_ovn_dbs.py` ONLY
   - "ipsec", "ipsec tunnels", "ipsec status", "ipsec configuration" → `analyze_ipsec.py` ONLY
   - "nodes", "node status", "node conditions" → `analyze_nodes.py` ONLY
   - "operators", "cluster operators", "degraded" → `analyze_clusteroperators.py` ONLY
   - "version", "cluster version", "update", "upgrade" → `analyze_clusterversion.py` ONLY
   - "events", "warnings", "errors" → `analyze_events.py` ONLY
   - "storage", "pv", "pvc", "volumes", "persistent" → `analyze_pvs.py` ONLY
   - "alerts", "prometheus", "monitoring" → `analyze_prometheus.py` ONLY

   **STEP 2: No specific component mentioned**

   If generic request like "analyze must-gather", "/must-gather:analyze", or "check the cluster", run ALL scripts in this order:
   1. ClusterVersion (`analyze_clusterversion.py`)
   2. Cluster Operators (`analyze_clusteroperators.py`)
   3. Nodes (`analyze_nodes.py`)
   4. Pods - problems only (`analyze_pods.py --problems-only`)
   5. Network (`analyze_network.py`)
   6. IPsec (`analyze_ipsec.py`)
   7. Events - warnings only (`analyze_events.py --type Warning --count 50`)
   8. etcd (`analyze_etcd.py`)
   9. Storage (`analyze_pvs.py`)
   10. Monitoring (`analyze_prometheus.py`)

3. **Execute Analysis Scripts**:
   ```bash
   python3 plugins/must-gather/skills/must-gather-analyzer/scripts/<script>.py <must-gather-path>
   ```

4. **Synthesize Results**: Generate findings and recommendations based on script output

## Return Value

The command outputs structured analysis results to stdout:

**For Component-Specific Analysis:**
- Script output for the requested component only
- Focused findings and recommendations

**For Full Analysis:**
- Organized sections for each component
- Executive summary of overall cluster health
- Prioritized list of critical issues
- Actionable recommendations
- Suggested log files to review

   ```
   Runs all analysis scripts and provides comprehensive cluster diagnostics.

   /must-gather:analyze check etcd health
   ```
   Asks for must-gather path, then runs only `analyze_etcd.py`.

   ```
   /must-gather:analyze ./must-gather/registry-ci-openshift-org-origin-4-20-...-sha256-abc123/ show me network issues
   ```
   Runs only `analyze_network.py` for network-specific analysis.

   ```
   /must-gather:analyze ./must-gather/registry-ci-openshift-org-origin-4-20-...-sha256-abc123/ analyze ipsec tunnels
   ```
   Runs only `analyze_ipsec.py` to check IPsec configuration and tunnel establishment.

## Notes

- **Must-Gather Path**: Always use the subdirectory containing `cluster-scoped-resources/` and `namespaces/`, not the parent directory
- **Script Dependencies**: Analysis scripts must be executable and have required Python dependencies installed
- **Error Handling**: If scripts are not found or must-gather path is invalid, clear error messages are displayed
- **Cross-Referencing**: The analysis attempts to correlate issues across components (e.g., degraded operator → failing pods)
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies patterns like multiple pod failures on the same node
- **Actionable Output**: Focuses on insights and recommendations rather than raw data dumps
- **Priority**: Issues are prioritized by severity (Critical > Warning > Info)

## Arguments

- **$1** (must-gather-path): Optional. Path to the must-gather directory (the subdirectory with the hash name). If not provided, the user will be asked.
- **$2+** (component): Optional. If keywords for a specific component are detected, only that component's analysis script will run. Otherwise, all scripts run.
